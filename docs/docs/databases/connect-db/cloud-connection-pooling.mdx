## Introduction

In Hasura Cloud, any non-free tier project is backed by several Hasura Server instances. These instances are
autoscaled to ensure reliable and consistent performance for your API. Each Hasura Server instance connects to data
sources through [connection pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool) which you are able to configure.

:::info Note

Connection pooling is only available for [PostgreSQL](/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#pgpoolsettings) and
[MSSQL](/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#mssqlpoolsettings) data sources.

:::

A connection pool can only hold live connections up to certain limit, which is specified through the `max_connections`
pool setting. The `max_connections` setting is applicable per server instance i.e, the cumulative number of maximum
connections across all instances in a project will be calculated as `number of server instances * max_connections`.
Under heavy load, when a project is scaled up, total live connections may exceed the data source's true limit. This
problem can be avoided by using **elastic connection pools**.

## Elastic connection pools

Elastic connection pools in Hasura Cloud have a flexible maximum number of connections as the pool's size is elastic in
nature. When a project is scaled up or down, Hasura Cloud automatically adjusts the number of maximum connections in a
data sources' pool, including read replicas, to ensure consistent **total maximum connections across all Hasura Server
instances**. You can define the upper limit of total maximum connections of a data source's pool per Hasura Cloud
project, via the `total_max_connections` pool setting.

:::info Note

At any given point in time, a pool's maximum connections = `total_max_connections / number of server instances`

:::

If both `total_max_connections` and `max_connections` are set, then `total_max_connections` will take precedence over
the `max_connections`. If neither is set, `total_max_connections` assumes a default value. If only `max_connections`
is set, as it is applicable per instance then Hasura Cloud will not adjust the maximum connections of individual
pools and hence elastic connection pooling is disabled.

:::tip

It is always recommended to set the `total_max_connections` pool setting in Hasura cloud to take advantage of elastic
connection pools.

:::

Hasura Cloud tries to keep total maximum connections across all server instances under `total_max_connections`.
Under heavy load, when a project scales up, the total maximum connections may slightly exceed the limit for a very
brief period of time during which Hasura Cloud is trying to adjust pools in existing Hasura Server instances. Always
set the `total_max_connections` value slightly lower than the database true total maximum limit in order to avoid
exceeding your resource limits.

### Metadata configuration

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

While adding a new database, under `Connection Settings`, set the desired `Total Max Connections` for primary and read
replica pools. To set or update `total_max_connections` for existing sources, head to the `Data > Databases > Manage >
[database-name] > Edit` page and scroll down to the `Connection Settings` section.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To set `total_max_connections`, update the `databases > [source-name] > databases.yaml` file inside the metadata
directory as per this example:

```yaml {9-10}
- name: default
  kind: postgres
  configuration:
    connection_info:
      use_prepared_statements: false
      database_url:
        from_env: PG_DATABASE_URL
      isolation_level: read-committed
      pool_settings:
        total_max_connections: 60
  tables: '!include default/tables/tables.yaml'
```

Apply the metadata using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

The `total_max_connections` pool setting can be set using the `<backend>_add_source` metadata API,

```http {14-15}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_add_source",
  "args": {
    "name": "pg1",
    "configuration": {
      "connection_info": {
        "database_url": {
           "from_env": "<DB_URL_ENV_VAR>"
         },
        "pool_settings": {
          "total_max_connections": 50,
          "idle_timeout": 180,
          "retries": 1,
          "pool_timeout": 360,
          "connection_lifetime": 600
        },
        "use_prepared_statements": true,
        "isolation_level": "read-committed",
      }
    },
    "replace_configuration": false
  }
}
```

or can be updated using the `<backend>_update_source` metadata API.

```http {14-15}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_update_source",
  "args": {
    "name": "pg1",
    "configuration": {
      "connection_info": {
        "database_url": {
           "from_env": "<DB_URL_ENV_VAR>"
         },
        "pool_settings": {
          "total_max_connections": 50,
          "idle_timeout": 180,
          "retries": 1,
          "pool_timeout": 360,
          "connection_lifetime": 600
        },
        "use_prepared_statements": true,
        "isolation_level": "read-committed",
      }
    }
  }
}
```
